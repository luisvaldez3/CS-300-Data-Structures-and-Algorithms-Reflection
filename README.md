Problem Statement

The main problem is that this course required me to create an advising tool for academic counselors. From what I experienced; I was required to manage course data from SNHU. The printing of an ordered course list. A challenge was choosing the appropriate data structures. I had to make sure the run-time was efficiency. I also factored the use for memory into my code.

Approach to the Problem

My approach to solving this problem was based on the data structure. I was able to assess which data structure would best depending on the requirements. I looked at the memory usage of vectors, hash tables, and trees. In my code, I thought that data structures were crucial since they impact the performance of software. Especially when dealing with large datasets.

Overcoming Roadblocks

Choosing the most appropriate data structure was probably my biggest roadblock. To overcome I checked different structures to see which one worked best for me. I thought that looking for debugging features also proved to be a great skillset to assist with my code.

Impact on Software Design and Program Development

Honestly, ever since I started this journey, and working on this project, I have been able to view many perspectives on software design and development. My approach has shifted from only being able to make a program work to how to make it work.

Evolution of Programming Practices

This project has significantly elevated my programming skills. I've learned to write code better now. Also, I can say that my code is maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
